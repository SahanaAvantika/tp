## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](hhttps://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete A10A`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete A10A")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete A10A` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the CareBook data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CareBook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add a Student
Logic Classes:
* <code>AddStudentCommand.java</code>
* <code>AddStudentCommandParser.java</code>

<code>AddStudentCommandParser</code> parses the input entered by user before executing <code>AddStudentCommand</code> to add a student to <code>Model</code>

This is illustrated in the activity diagram below:

<puml src="diagrams/AddStudentCommand.puml" width="600"/>

* isValidPhone ensures that phone number is exactly 8 digits and begin with either 6, 8 or 9.
* isValidEmail ensures that email has the @ domain.
* isUniqueId ensures that <StudentId> is unique.
* isValidParentName and isValidStudentName both ensure that they only contain alphanumeric characters

If all the above conditions are satisfied, the student is added to the model.

### Export Student Records
Logic Classes:
* <code>ExportCommand.java</code>
* <code>ExportCommandParser.java</code>

<code>ExportCommandParser</code> parses the input entered by user before executing <code>ExportCommand</code> to export
student name, parent name, student ID, parent email, parent phone number and attendance history of all students in <code>Model</cod>.

This is illustrated in the activity diagram below:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportCommand.puml" width="600"/>

* isValidFileName ensures that fileName only contains alphanumeric characters or underscore.
* isValidFileLength ensures that fileName does not exceed 100 characters.

If all the above conditions are satisfied, export command will be successfully executed and a .csv file will be created in directory where carebook.jar file is placed.

### Delete a Student 
Logic Classes:
* <code>DeleteStudentCommand.java</code>
* <code>DeleteStudentCommandParser.java</code>

<code>DeleteStudentCommandParser</code> parses the input entered by user before executing <code>DeleteStudentCommand</code> to 
delete a student from <code>Model</code>

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentCommand.puml" width="600"/>

* isValidId ensures that the studentId entered already exists in CareBook

If the above condition is satisfied, delete student command will be successfully executed.

### Find a Student
Logic classes:
* <code>FindStudentCommand.java</code>
* <code>FindStudentCommandParser.java</code>

<puml src="diagrams/FindStudentCommand.puml" width="600"/>

* isValidId ensures that the studentId entered already exists in CareBook

If the above condition is satisfied, find student command will be successfully executed.

<code>FindStudentCommandParser</code> parses the input entered by user before executing <code>FindStudentCommand</code> to
find a student from <code>Model</code>

## **Appendix: Effort**
1. **Difficulty Level and Challenges Faced**

   Our project builds on AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) but required significant refactoring to better fit our target users' needs. As a result, the complexity of data management, validation, and UI representation increased.<br><br>
    **Key challenges included:**
    * Extensive refactoring: From `person` model to `student` model.
    * Editing and updating test cases: Ensuring existing test cases remained valid after structural changes while writing new ones for added functionalities.
    * Maintaining code consistency: Ensuring that refactored components integrated smoothly without introducing regressions.<br><br>
    
1. **Effort Required**

   The project effort was distributed across key areas:<br>
   * Feature Development (45%) – Modifying existing commands and implementing new commands (e.g. mark, markall, export).
   * Testing & Debugging (30%) – Updating test cases, refactoring test structure, and ensuring correctness after modifications.
   * Data Management & Storage (25%) – Modifying JSON storage to handle new fields in `Student` model.<br><br>
    
1. **Achievements**
    * Successfully modified AB3 to align with our target users' needs while maintaining its core functionality.
    * Refactored the codebase effectively, improving maintainability and extensibility.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team members (count): 5

1. **Improve UI (Main Window and Find Window) for long names and addresses**: When dealing with long name and addresses, CareBook truncates these values in both the main and find window. 
Furthermore, find window cannot be resized. To improve this in the future, we would make the UI display long name and address values and make find window 
resizable.

2. **Modify edit command to detect changes**: When editing student contact, CareBook does not recognise that no changes are made and edit command is allowed
to go through without throwing an error. For future improvements, we would make changes such that edit command will detect no changes are being made
and throw an error.

3. **Modify UI to display student name and studentId in sorted order**: When adding new students, student that has just been added
will appear at the bottom of the UI display. This makes it hard for users to track their students. For future improvements,
we would implement a comparator class to sort students by their student ID.

4. **Modify export command to export student records to different file types and different directories**: When exporting student records,
the exported file is automatically saved as a .csv file to the current directory of carebook.jar file. When user 
tries to copy and paste records from .csv file to file types like excel, there is a slight formatting issue. For future improvements,
we would implement a method to allow users to export to a different file type and directory of their choice.

5. **Modify add command to allow names with special characters**: Currently, users can only add student and parent names that 
consist of alphanumeric characters and space. For future improvements, we plan to allow users to add names with special characters like
@, / or names in different languages (e.g. Arabic, Chinese).

6. **Modify add command to validate that email contains a period**: Currently, users can enter emails that do not contain 
a period in the domain (e.g. a@bc). For future improvements, we plan to enhance email validation by ensuring that the 
domain part of the email contains at least one period (e.g. example.com) to better reflect real-world email formats.
